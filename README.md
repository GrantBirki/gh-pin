Pin Docker container images to an exact index digest for better build reproducibility.

## About ‚≠ê

This project is a gh cli extension that is used to pin Docker container images to an exact index digest. This is useful for ensuring that builds are reproducible and secure.

Container images referenced by mutable tags (like `latest` or `v1.0`) can change over time, leading to inconsistent builds and potential security vulnerabilities. When an image tag is updated to point to a new version, your builds may suddenly start using different base images, dependencies, or even malicious content without your knowledge.

The `gh-pin` tool solves this by automatically converting mutable image tags to immutable digest references. Instead of `ubuntu:latest`, your files will reference `ubuntu@sha256:abc123...`, ensuring that the exact same image is used every time. This approach follows security best practices recommended by organizations like the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/online-programs/cloud-native-live-automate-pinning-github-actions-and-container-images-to-their-digests/) and [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/) for supply chain security.

Key benefits include enhanced security through supply chain attack prevention, guaranteed build reproducibility across environments and time, compliance with security frameworks that require immutable references, and improved debugging capabilities since you always know exactly which image version was used.

> Moving towards immutable image references lives in the same ecosystem as [Hermetic Builds](https://software.birki.io/posts/hermetic-builds/) which is a topic I am passionate about and a key reason for building this CLI.

## Installation üíª

Install this gh cli extension by running the following command:

```bash
gh extension install grantbirki/gh-pin
```

### Upgrading üì¶

You can upgrade this extension by running the following command:

```bash
gh ext upgrade pin
```

## Usage üöÄ

### Basic Usage

Pin images in a specific Dockerfile:

```bash
gh pin Dockerfile
```

Pin images in a specific Docker compose file:

```bash
gh pin docker-compose.yml
```

Pin all Docker images in the current directory and subdirectories:

```bash
gh pin
```

Pin all images in a specific directory and its subdirectories:

```bash
gh pin /path/to/project
```

### Command Line Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--algo` | Digest algorithm to check for (sha256, sha512, etc.) | `sha256` |
| `--dry-run` | Preview changes without writing files | `false` |
| `--expand-registry` | Expand short image names to fully qualified registry names | `false` |
| `--no-color` | Disable colored output | `false` |
| `--pervasive` | Scan all YAML files, not just docker-compose files | `false` |
| `--recursive` | Scan directories recursively | `true` |
| `--version` | Show version information | `false` |

### Examples

**Preview changes without modifying files:**

```bash
gh pin --dry-run
```

**Pin images and expand registry names:**

```bash
# Without --expand-registry (default):
# ubuntu:latest ‚Üí ubuntu@sha256:abc123...

# With --expand-registry:
# ubuntu:latest ‚Üí docker.io/library/ubuntu:latest@sha256:abc123...
gh pin --expand-registry
```

**Scan all YAML files (including Kubernetes manifests, CI configs, etc.):**

```bash
gh pin --pervasive
```

**Combine multiple options:**

```bash
gh pin --dry-run --pervasive --expand-registry /path/to/project
```

### Supported File Types

| File Type | Detection Pattern | Description |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| **Dockerfiles** | `Dockerfile*` | Any file starting with "Dockerfile" (ex: `Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.test`, `Dockerfile.dev`, etc) |
| **Docker Compose** | `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.yaml` | Standard Docker Compose files |
| **Generic YAML** | `*.yml`, `*.yaml` | When using `--pervasive` flag |

### Output Examples

```bash
$ gh pin --dry-run
üìå [DOCKERFILE] ubuntu:latest ‚Üí ubuntu@sha256:7c06e91f61fa88c08cc74f7e1b7c69ae24910d745357e0dfe1d2c0322aaf20f9
üìå [COMPOSE] nginx:alpine ‚Üí nginx@sha256:2d194b9da5f3b2f19d8b03b48d36c3f8af53e24b96b8c48a82db8d7b6e6e4c6a
```

### Exit Codes

- `0`: Success - all images processed successfully
- `1`: Error - failed to process one or more files or images

## How it Works üìö

The `gh-pin` CLI scans your project files and replaces mutable image tags with immutable digest references for better security and reproducibility.

### High-Level Process

1. **File Discovery**: Recursively scans directories to find Docker-related files:
   - `Dockerfile*` (any file starting with "Dockerfile")
   - `docker-compose.yml/yaml` files
   - Generic `.yml/.yaml` files containing Docker images (when using `--pervasive` flag)

2. **Image Detection**: Parses files to identify container image references:
   - Extracts `FROM` statements in Dockerfiles
   - Finds `image:` fields in Compose/YAML files
   - Skips images that already have digest pinning

3. **Registry Lookup**: For each unpinned image, performs efficient registry queries:
   - Makes HTTP `HEAD` requests to container registries (Docker Hub, GHCR, etc.)
   - Retrieves manifest metadata without downloading full manifest content
   - Extracts the SHA256 digest that uniquely identifies the image

4. **File Updates**: Replaces mutable tags with immutable digest references:
   - `nginx:latest` ‚Üí `nginx@sha256:abc123...`
   - `ubuntu:20.04` ‚Üí `ubuntu@sha256:def456...`
   - Preserves original formatting and indentation

### Benefits

- **Reproducible Builds**: Same digest always references the exact same image
- **Security**: Prevents supply chain attacks from tag manipulation
- **Efficiency**: Uses HEAD requests to minimize network bandwidth
- **Compatibility**: Works with all OCI-compatible registries

## Verifying Release Binaries üîè

This project uses [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) to build binaries and [actions/attest-build-provenance](https://github.com/actions/attest-build-provenance) to publish the provenance of the release.

You can verify the release binaries by following these steps:

1. Download a release from the [releases page](https://github.com/grantbirki/gh-pin/releases).
2. Verify it `gh attestation verify --owner github ~/Downloads/darwin-arm64` (an example for darwin-arm64).
